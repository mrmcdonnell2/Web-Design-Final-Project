    <div class="bio-text">
      <p class="p1">Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston on January 17th, 1706. He was the fifteenth child of his father, and is said to have been the leader among the Franklin sons. Although attributed to having invented many revolutionary concepts, Franklin did not have the highest of educations. Instead, he was schooled for two years before stopping entirely when he was 10. At age 17, he left his family and moved to the city of Philadelphia.</p>

      <p class="p1">There, Franklin worked in printer ships and continued to educate himself through reading. He created the idea of the subscription library by 1730, and had become publisher of The Pennsylvania Gazette. He mainly wrote about social reforms and action, which built up an image among those who read his works.

      <p class="p1">In 1730, Franklin’s first child, William, was born. However, William was called “illegitimate”, as his mother was not Benjamin’s wife. Despite this, Franklin married a woman named Deborah Read later that year. He would later go on to have two more children, one of whom died early after being born.</p>

      <p class="p1">Much of Franklin’s reputation as an author came from Poor Richard’s Almanack, a yearly release that he published. The first issue released in 1733 and continued until 1758.</p>

      <p class="p1">As time went on, Franklin became more of an activist, helping to promote education and other services. He was particularly involved in Philadelphia, helping to open up the first hospital in the United States there.</p>

      <p class="p1">During the American Revolution, Franklin was an avid Patriot who used his writings to inspire those who wished to break free from Great Britain. In 1776, he was chosen as one of the few people in charge of creating the Declaration of Independence.</p>

      <p class="p1">Meanwhile, Franklin’s first son William, who had become a Governor of New Jersey during the 1760s, opposed his father’s side in the conflict. Instead, he stayed a Loyalist who sided with the British forces. William eventually left to live in Britain and never reconciled with his father.</p>

      <center><p class="p1">After the Revolution, Franklin continued his political affairs, often traveling to France and honored there for his actions. He was also particularly involved in Philadelphia politics, becoming the sixth president of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania in 1875. He was elected to four full terms across two years. In 1787, he also served as a delegate to the Philadelphia Convention. Along with this, Franklin was deeply engaged in abolition, writing and speaking to free slaves that were common during his lifetime.</p>

      <p class="p1">During the later portion of his life, Franklin was plagued by obesity, which caused several health problems. The main issue that he faced was gout, which gradually worsened as he got older. After the Constitution was signed in 1787, Franklin did not make many public appearances. Finally, on April 17th, 1790, Franklin died in his home with his family with him.</p></center>

    <p class="p2">INVENTIONS</p>
  </div>

  <center>
    <p class="p1">Throughout his life, Benjamin Franklin created a number of inventions, several of which would go on to be refined and turn into objects commonly used in everyday life, even in modern times. This is because of one aspect of Franklin’s inventions. He he never patented them, meaning what anyone is free to improve or redesign his ideas. Because of this, many of them have evolved over time and are commonly used today.</p>

    <p class="p1">Here are six of his most influential inventions!</p>

      <h2>Bifocals</h2>

    <img src="images/img_bifocals.png"></img>
    <p class="p1">Franklin is noted for inventing bifocals around 1760, a type of glasses that aids people who struggle to see both far away and up close. People with glasses typically either use convex lenses, to see close objects, or concave lenses, to see farther away.</p>

    <p class="p1">With bifocals, concave lenses are on the top of the glasses, to see straight ahead. Meanwhile, convex lenses rest on the bottom, so a person can see an object below them clearly.</p>

      <h2>Lightning rod</h2>

    <p class="p1">Franklin is one of the first people to find evidence of a link between lightning and electricity. In 1752, he invented the iron lightning rod, used in his experiments around electricity.</p>

    <p class="p1">The main purpose of a lightning rod is to be attached onto a building, where it would attract lightning during a storm. Lightning will strike the rod instead of the building, preventing property damage and electrocution.</p>

      <h2>Glass harmonica</h2>

    <p class="p1">A unique instrument, the glass harmonica was invented by Franklin in 1761. Originally called the “armonica”, this actually predates the modern instrument associated with the word today.</p>

    <p class="p1">To play the glass harmonica, a person moistens their fingers with water and presses down against a series of spinning glass bowls. Historic musicians such as Mozart and Beethoven have composed songs for this instrument, even if it is not typically used today.</p>

      <h2>Franklin stove</h2>
    </center>
    <img src="images/img_stove.png"></img>
    <p class="p1">The Franklin stove was created in 1742, used much like a typical fireplace at the time. However, this invention used more advanced machinery in order to produce more heat and less smoke. Along with having a box shape, this was a new concept.</p>

    <p class="p1">Because Franklin did not believe in patenting his creations, this stove system was enhanced by others throughout the years. Even today, most fireplaces still are similar to his original design.</p>

      <h2>Electrostatic machine</h2>

    <img src="images/img_static.png"></img>
    <p class="p1">During his experiments with electricity, Franklin created the electrostatic machine in 1747. While others had generated electricity before, this machine did so easily and without much manual effort. They were often used in laboratories that dealt with electricity.</p>

    <p class="p1">Because of this machine, Franklin discovered positive and negative charges.</p>

      <h2>Swimming fins</h2>
    </center>
    <img src="images/img_fin.png"></img>
    <p class="p1">Swimming fins were one of Franklin’s first inventions, being created around 1717.</p>

    <p class="p1">These fins were two oval pieces of wood with a handle attached. The idea is that when a person grabs onto the handles, they can swim easier because of extra thrust. While Franklin succeeded, his early design tended to hurt the swimmer’s wrists.</p>

    <p class="p1">Franklin’s invention was later turned into hand paddles, and now are made of plastic with small holes in them. This allows for easier use.</p>
